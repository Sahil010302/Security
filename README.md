<h1>Apartment Visitor Management App</h1> <h2>Description</h2> <p>The Apartment Visitor Management App is designed to streamline visitor registration and access processes in apartment complexes. It offers several key features that improve efficiency, enhance security, and promote sustainability.</p> <h3>Features</h3> <h2>Reduced Paper Usage:</h2> <p>By eliminating the need for manual logbooks, the app helps save paper, reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability. All visitor records are stored digitally.</p> <h2>Efficient Data Management:</h2> <p>Visitor data is securely stored in a database, allowing for easy access, search, and sorting. This saves time and effort compared to manually managing physical logbooks, and it enables quick retrieval of past records.</p> <h2>Login and ID Assignment System:</h2> <p>Each user, including delivery personnel, newspaper vendors, and visitors, must complete a login process where credentials such as their Aadhaar number and other necessary details are entered. Upon registration, users are assigned a unique 5-digit ID number. This ID serves as their identity while entering the apartment complex.</p> <h2>ID Verification for Delivery and Service Personnel:</h2> <p>When delivery personnel (e.g., newspaper vendors, delivery people) arrive at the apartment, they are required to provide their assigned 5-digit ID number to the security guard. The guard enters the ID into the system, which verifies the details and confirms the visitorâ€™s identity before granting access.</p> <h2>Emergency Notification System:</h2> <p>In case of an emergency, users can press an "Alert" button within the app, which immediately triggers a notification to the security staff. This ensures rapid response and allows the security team to act promptly.</p> <h2>Visitor Check-In Process</h2> <p>The check-in process outlines the steps for visitors to check into the community with the assistance of security staff. It includes preconditions, flow, and postconditions to ensure a smooth and secure experience.</p> <h2>Visitor Check-Out Process</h2> <p>The check-out process explains how visitors can check out of the community when leaving. Security staff will update the visitor's status in the app, and confirmation will be provided to both the visitor and the guard.</p> <h2>Delivery Check-In Process</h2> <p>This process describes how delivery personnel can check into the community when arriving with packages. The system records delivery details and grants the necessary access for smooth package deliveries.</p>
